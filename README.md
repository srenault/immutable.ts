# Typescript-fp

This Typescript library brings some concepts from functionnal programming.
Some immutable structures like List and Option are provided.
The API is strongly inspired from Scala.

Several grunt tasks are defined to build this project:

* The _default_ grunt task compiles the library, copy it to the sample project, and compiles the sample project.
* The _dev_ task is the same but with the live reload.
* The _lib_ task compiles the library.
* The _sample_ task copy the last version of the library to the sample project, and compiles the sample project.
